# AI Agent Policy

AI agents may help with development when their changes are scoped, reviewed,
and verified like any other contribution.

## Required Reading

Before editing, agents should read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `doc/testing.md`
- `doc/cmake-guide.md` for build or CMake changes
- This document

## Appropriate Uses

- Focused bug fixes.
- Test additions.
- Documentation updates.
- Build and CI maintenance.
- Mechanical refactors that preserve behavior.

## Restricted Uses

AI agents should not independently:

- Redesign core architecture without maintainer direction.
- Weaken tests, warnings, static analysis, or CI.
- Add large dependencies or generated code without approval.
- Publish releases, rotate credentials, or change repository permissions.
- Rewrite vendored GLAD, KHR, or Nuklear code as part of unrelated work.

## Disclosure

PRs should disclose meaningful AI assistance, list docs read, summarize what
was changed, and record validation.
